Vehicle Management System 🚗🏍️
This Python program demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Features:
✅ Vehicle (Base Class) – Stores common attributes: brand, model, year.
✅ Car (Subclass) – Adds fuel type and overrides display_info().
✅ Bike (Subclass) – Adds engine capacity and overrides display_info().
✅ Encapsulation – Uses private attributes with getter methods.
✅ Polymorphism – Overridden display_info() and unique start_engine() methods.

Output Example:
Toyota Corolla (2022)
 - Fuel: Petrol
Vroom! The car engine is started.

Yamaha R15 (2021)
 - Engine: 155cc
Rev! The bike engine is started.
This script organizes and displays vehicle details in a structured way. 🚀
